Brief Introduction About Myself
I’m a tech enthusiast and aspiring software engineer driven by the challenge of building systems that solve real-world problems. My journey began with a curiosity for how things work — and grew into a passion for creating software that can transform communities and improve lives.

I'm especially interested in backend development and cloud integration, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies, contribute to open-source, and collaborate on meaningful projects.
